Button switches are simple, mechanical devices that can open or close an electrical circuit. Button switches are used to send signals to the Raspberry Pi, allowing you to control and interact with your projects.

When you press a button switch connected to a GPIO pin, it completes the circuit, sending a signal to the Raspberry Pi that the button has been pressed. This signal can be used to trigger various actions in your project, such as turning on an LED, starting a motor, or even executing a piece of code.
